    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm <strong>Hutesh Vidhate</strong>, a passionate and disciplined
      full-stack developer specializing in the <strong>MERN stack</strong>. With
      a strong grasp of JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, Express. I
      build scalable web applications that are both performance-optimized and
      user-friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve built multiple full-stack projects from scratch, implementing
      responsive UI, REST APIs, authentication systems, and dynamic database
      integration. Each project reflects my problem-solving ability, attention
      to detail, and dedication to clean, maintainable code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether it's a <strong>React.js SPA</strong>, a{" "}
      <strong>Node.js backend</strong>, or a <strong>MongoDB schema</strong> — I
      design, build, and deliver. I'm on a mission to create real-world impact
      through technology while continuing my journey as a lifelong learner and
      leader.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s build something meaningful together — with code, with courage, and
      with purpose.
    </p>
